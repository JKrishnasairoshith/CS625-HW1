### My Favorite Olympic Sport
One of my favorite Olympic sports is **basketball**. The USA has won the most Olympic GOLD medals in basketball in both the 2020 (Japan) and 2024 (France) Olympics. I enjoy watching the exciting moments of the game, especially the **_three-point shots_**. I always think of **Stephen Curry**, a fantastic player who can hit incredible three-pointers. Basketball is such an exciting game! You can check out more details about basketball's Olympic history [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_at_the_Summer_Olympics).
